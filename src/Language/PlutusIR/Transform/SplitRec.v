(* A binding group (Let without a body) *)
Definition binding_group := (Recursivity * list Binding)%type.

(*
Assuming globally unique variables, the new binding groups much satisfy:
  - Well-scoped: each free variable in a binding RHS is bound
  - All bindings equals those in the let-rec before transformaton

Note that strictness of bindings does not matter: if one of the (strict)
bindings diverges, the whole let-block diverges. This behaviour remains when
regrouping/reordering all bindings.
